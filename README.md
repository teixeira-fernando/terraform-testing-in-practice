## Microservices 


- **Review Collector**
- **Review Analyzer**
- **Frontend Review** (React + Vite): A web interface for submitting product reviews, connected to the backend microservices.

## Stack


- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Gradle**
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code for AWS)
- **Test Containers**
- **Localstack**
- **JUnit 5**
- **AWS (S3, SQS)**
- **React** (Frontend)
- **Vite** (Frontend tooling)
- **Nginx** (Frontend container)

## Requirements to run it locally

- **Docker**
- **Node**
- **Gradle and Java**
- **Terraform** (optional, for Infrastructure as Code setup)
- **An AWS account** (if you want to run it using real services; you can use LocalStack which does not require an AWS Account)


## Instructions to run the project


There are different options to run the project. The frontend module is included and can be run together with the backend services using Docker Compose.

#### 1 - Docker - using Localstack


You can simply run this docker-compose command to run the backend services, the frontend module, and Localstack:

```Shell
docker compose up
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### 2 - Docker - using real AWS services

For this option, you need to have a created AWS account and set 2 environment variables, AWS_ACCESSKEY and AWS_SECRETKEY. Depending on your machine OS, you will have a different command to set those environment variables. If you using linux, you can simply run the following:

```Shell
export AWS_ACCESSKEY=YOUR_ACCESSKEY_HERE
```

```Shell
export AWS_SECRETKEY=YOUR_SECRETKEY_HERE
```


Now, we can run this single docker command to run the backend services and the frontend module using real AWS services from your account.

```Shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-real-AWS-services.yml up
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### 3 - Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This project includes Terraform configuration to manage AWS resources (S3 bucket and SQS queue) as Infrastructure as Code. Terraform supports both LocalStack (development) and real AWS (production).

**Prerequisites:** [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

**Quick Start with LocalStack:**

```Shell
# Initialize Terraform (first time only)
cd terraform
terraform init

# Plan and apply with LocalStack configuration
terraform plan -var-file=local.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=local.tfvars

# Start the services (in another terminal, from project root)
docker compose up
```

**For Production AWS:**

```Shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"

cd terraform
terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

📖 **For comprehensive Terraform documentation**, see [TERRAFORM.md](TERRAFORM.md).

#### 4 - Using your favorite IDE

You can also run the project using your favorite IDE. As mentioned, you just need the Java JDK and Gradle properly installed and configured on your machine. Let me show you how to easily run the 2 services from the project in that way.

 <b>Run review-collector service:</b>
```Gradle
./gradlew :review-collector:bootRun
```

 <b>Run review-analyzer service:</b>
```Gradle
./gradlew :review-analyzer:bootRun
```

## QA Strategy

* Unit Tests: <b>Junit5 and Mockito</b>
* Integration tests: <b>Spring Boot Test, TestContainers, Localstack</b>
* E2E tests:  <b>Playwright, Testcontainers, Localstack</b>
* Quality Metrics:
    * Mutation Tests/Mutation Coverage: <b>PITest</b> (TODO)
  * Code Coverage: <b>JaCoCo</b> reports for backend services in pull request pipelines (XML + HTML artifacts)
    * Technical Debt, Code Smells and other complementary metrics : <b>Sonar Cloud</b>
* Contract tests: <b>Pact framework</b> (TODO)
* Continuous Integration: This project uses Github Action for Continuous Integration, where it executes all the tests and Sonar Cloud Analysis for every pull request, making easier the process of integration of every new code, also facilitating the process of Code Review.

## Testcontainers and LocalStack together in action

This project uses Testcontainers JS and LocalStack to create a robust, fully automated E2E testing environment for cloud microservices. The setup in `frontend-review/e2e/tests` orchestrates all required services (backend microservices, frontend, and LocalStack) using Docker Compose, managed programmatically via Testcontainers.

**How it works:**
- Testcontainers JS launches all containers defined in the Docker Compose file, including LocalStack (which emulates AWS services like S3 and SQS).
- Custom wait strategies ensure each service is ready before tests run (e.g., waiting for health endpoints or log messages).
- After startup, Testcontainers executes commands inside the LocalStack container to create required S3 buckets and SQS queues for the tests.
- Playwright E2E tests interact with the running frontend and backend services, verifying the full review submission and analysis flow.
- The entire environment is ephemeral: containers are started before tests and stopped/cleaned up automatically after.

This approach ensures your tests run against a realistic, production-like environment, with AWS dependencies simulated by LocalStack, and all orchestration handled in code for maximum reproducibility and CI/CD compatibility.

**How to run the E2E tests:**

From the frontend-review folder, you can run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Or, to see all logs during test execution:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:all-logs
```

## Pipeline Configuration

Even though this project is using a single repository, it is still a microservices project. The CI/CD process is organized to make each service modular and independent. Below is an overview of the pipelines created for every pull request to the main branch:

### Pull Request Pipelines

* **review-analyzer-pull-request**
  * Builds and runs the unit and integration tests for the `review-analyzer` service.
  * Generates JaCoCo coverage report and uploads it as workflow artifact (`review-analyzer-coverage-report`).
* **review-collector-pull-request**
  * Builds and runs the unit and integration tests for the `review-collector` service.
  * Generates JaCoCo coverage report and uploads it as workflow artifact (`review-collector-coverage-report`).
* **frontend-review-pull-request**
  * Builds and runs the unit, integration and e2e tests for the `frontend-review` frontend.

### Release Pipelines

After changes are merged into the main branch, the following pipelines are used:

* **review-analyzer-release**
  * Builds the Docker image for the `review-analyzer` service and pushes it to the Docker registry.
* **review-collector-release**
  * Builds the Docker image for the `review-collector` service and pushes it to the Docker registry.
* **frontend-review-release**
  * Builds the Docker image for the `frontend-review` frontend and pushes it to the Docker registry.
## Development info


### Frontend Review Module

The `frontend-review` module is a React application for submitting product reviews. It is containerized with Docker and served via Nginx. You can run it together with the backend services using Docker Compose as described above. For local development, you can also run:

```Shell
cd frontend-review
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
